These are the basic settings for all documentation generated by Doxygen.

    ==========================================================
     DO NOT CHANGE THESE WITHOUT DISCUSSION AT A ROSE MEETING
    ==========================================================

These settings are included into multiple doxygen configurations, some
of which aren't distributed with ROSE.

To override a setting, include the file into your own Doxygen
configuration file using "@INCLUDE = _file_name_" and then override
the setting by giving it a new value.
