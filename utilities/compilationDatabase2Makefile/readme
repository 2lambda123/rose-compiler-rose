This is a utility program to convert a compilation database json file into a single makefile.
The motivation is to avoid hacking into users' build systems in order to invoke a ROSE-based tool.
With the single makefile, we can freely replace the compiler name and options without understanding the complex build systems.

To generate a compilation database json file:
* for GNU autoconf/automake build systems: We recommend https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear .
* for CMake build systems: please use the cmake option -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 

To build the tool, please make sure your gcc supports C++11, type 
  make

To test the tool, type
  make check

Example usage: 
 ./cdb2makefile --help // show help information

 ./cdb2makefile --input="tests/amrex_compile_commands.json" --output=makefile-amrx
