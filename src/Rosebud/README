This is Rosebud, which reads a C++-like domain specific language (DSL)
for defining ROSE IR node types, and generates a variety of outputs
including YAML, ROSETTA input, and C++ source code.

The Rosebud input language and API documentation can be found in the
Doxygen-generated documentation for the `::Rosebud` namespace, or you
can look at the source documentation in src/Rosebud/BasicTypes.h.
