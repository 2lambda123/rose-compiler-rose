This is Rosebud, which reads a C++-like domain specific language (DSL)
for defining ROSE IR node types, and generates a variety of outputs
including YAML, ROSETTA input, and C++ source code.

This directory contains the Rosebud tool and documentation for its API
and is probably not that useful to people trying to define ROSE IR
nodes. But...

The documentation for the DSL is located in the directory that
contains the input for Rosebud, namely $ROSE/src/AstNodes. See the
README in that directory.
