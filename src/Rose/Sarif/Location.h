/** Location or region for a result.
 *
 *  A location is either a source location or a binary location and defines a particular point in an artifact. Source locations
 *  have a file name, a 1-origin line number, and an optional 1-origin column number. A binary location is a binary specimen name
 *  and an address within the specimen.
 *
 *  A region consists of two locations: a begin location (inclusive) and an end location (exclusive). The two locations must refer
 *  to the same artifact, and the end location must be greater than the begin location. For source regions, if a begin location
 *  lacks a column number, then column 1 is assumed and if an end location lacks a column number then one past the last column is
 *  assumed.
 *
 *  Each location may also have a @ref message "text message" property.
 *
 *  Example source location:
 *
 *  @snippet{trimleft} sarifUnitTests.C position_source_example
 *
 *  Example binary location:
 *
 *  @snippet{trimleft} sarifUnitTests.C log_with_location */
