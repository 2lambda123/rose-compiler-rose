/** Main class for model checking.
 *
 *  This class holds or references everything needed for model checking and runs the model checker. Most interaction with
 *  the model checker framework is through this object.
 *
 *  The engine maintains a priority queue of paths on which to work, and the work is farmed out to some combination of
 *  managed worker threads and/or unmanaged user threads. A unit of work is generally one node (the last node) of a path,
 *  which consists of executing the node symbolically, finding a list of control flow successor nodes, creating a new path
 *  for each of those successors, testing whether any of the new paths are feasible (using an SMT solver), and adding the
 *  feasible paths to the priority queue. The new paths are thus one node longer than the original path.
 *
 *  Part of the execution of a node involves checking execution state against a model specification. For instance, checking
 *  that no memory reads or writes occur to addresses within the first reserved page of memory. If a violation of the
 *  specification is detected, then a tag describing the violation can be attached to the path and the path can be added to a
 *  second priority queue that holds the "interesting" paths.
 *
 *  The engine is mainly responsible containing the prioritiy queues, managing worker threads and knowing about user threads,
 *  and handing work out to the threads.  Many of the components of model checking are user-defined specializations of model
 *  checker base classes, and the @ref Engine is reponsible for pointing to all of them so their virtual functions can be
 *  called at the appropriate times. */
