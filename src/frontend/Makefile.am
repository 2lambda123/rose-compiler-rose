# Until we revisit this this, we want to include specific documentation that has been put into this directory.
# Note that OpenFortranParser_SAGE_Connection has the newer work to support Fortran in ROSE.  This work
# is part of a contract to add Fortran support to ROSE using the Open 64 compiler.  It supports a roughly
# Fortran 77 level of details, however it uses IR nodes that have been extended or removed (in a few cases)
# as part of adding the Fortran 2003 support using the Open Fortan Parser.
