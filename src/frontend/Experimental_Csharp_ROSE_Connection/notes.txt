Notes on the support for C# in ROSE

Our approach is to use the Csharp language support for building C# compiler tools (called "Roslyn").
This library support has been especially difficult to install, but onc installed it appears to work 
well on at least the introductory C# programs that I have built to conduct initial testing.


Roslyn generates an AST with embedded syntax that can be selectively ignored.
It apears to support symbols and types, so all initial indications are that 
this could work well for supporting the trnslation into ROSE IR and thus allowing
ROSE to support the C# language.
