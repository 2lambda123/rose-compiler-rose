- Install the GNAT tools and compiler
- Build and install the GNATcoll library (core, plus Iconv and GMP bindings)
- Install every Python dependency.

2020-06-03 - Installed GNAT 2020 GPL, which includes libadalang, at: /collab/usr/global/tools/rose/toss_3_x86_64_ib/GNAT/2020

Simple example works.  Need to install gnatcoll for more functionality.

Gnatcoll is installed.
