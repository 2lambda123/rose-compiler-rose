# Tools for testing ROSE portability

The tools in this directory test whether the ROSE library and some
associated tools and tests can be built with a wide variety of
software dependencies.

The architecture consists of a central database that stores configuration
information and results, and a distributed collection of slave
machines. Anyone who has access to the database can run these scripts
and contribute to the testing.
