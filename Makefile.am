# DQ (1/18/2009): Added demo directory to support showoffs :-).
# DQ "config" and "src" must preceed any other directories, and 
# "tutorial" and "exampleTranslators" must preceed "docs" since 
# they generate data that is subsequently used in the generated 
# ROSE documentation (examples, input codes, and generated output).
# SUBDIRS = config src projects tests tutorial exampleTranslators docs developersScratchSpace tools proposals scripts
# SUBDIRS = libltdl config src projects tests tutorial exampleTranslators docs tools scripts demo binaries

# DQ (2/6/2010): changed the order of tests, the projects directory now follows the tests directory.
# This was something that was discussed in email previously with the group.  Thei point is to have the
# first tests run by make check be the most relevant tests (e.g. can we compile C++ code).
# SUBDIRS = libltdl config src tests projects tutorial exampleTranslators docs tools scripts demo binaries
